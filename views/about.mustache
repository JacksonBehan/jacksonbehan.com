        My name is Jackson Behan, I am 28 years old and I live in Albany, NY.
        I always hated school. When I was 26 I discovered programming, and went to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco to learn how to code. Afterwards, I got a job within a month in Las Vegas but it wasn’t the best situation for a young programmer with no experience or confidence. I left that job eventually for another and I really began to grow and love my job. Now I am looking for a new opportunity back home in the Albany area.

          It wasn't until I was 26 years old that I discovered what I wanted to do with my life. I was never interested in any subject in school, from grade school through college. In college I was undecided for as long as possible and settled on accounting. My reasons were I got an A in my gen ed accounting course and accountants make good money. I got my bachelors degree but never pursued a job in it because I hated it. I spent about 4 years working crummy jobs: a pizza joint, a restaurant, a bank, while trying to pursue a poker-playing career. I do love poker but it is a grind. It’s even more of a grind when you live in Albany and the closest casino is about 2 hours away. For about a year and a half I only played poker and made that trip multiple times throughout the week but it just wasn’t practical.

          My Mom read something about these coding bootcamps and sent me the article. I didn’t know what coding meant but it looked intriguing. I started doing some tutorials on codecademy and I just thought it was fun. It didn’t take me long to decide I was going to apply to some of these bootcamps because this was the first practical thing in my life that I’ve ever been excited about (my other dreams besides professional poker player were NFL superstar, NBA superstar, rock star, and movie star). I got accepted into Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. My girlfriend at the time and I moved to Las Vegas about a month before I went to the bootcamp. We moved there for a variety of reasons and pursuing a poker career wasn’t necessarily one of them. The bootcamp was extremely difficult for me; everyone else had previous knowledge and had been interested in tech for a long time. It was just too much information for me to process not knowing anything. Every few hours we were learning new things and I just felt like I was drowning. After I graduated I still felt completely unprepared.

          Regardless, I was able to land a job in Vegas within a month. It was a good situation at first, I was hired as an intern, wasn’t a lot of pressure and I was able to take my time and learn new things.  Things started to change there though and we didn’t really have a web development team, they outsourced almost all of their dev work to a company in china. I was pushed into other roles that had nothing to do with programming. I left that job for another and there I got what I needed, immersed in code all day every day and that’s when things really started to click for me and I began to feel comfortable as a developer.
